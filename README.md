# ESA phi-lab challenge 'Enhnced Sentinel 2 Agriculture'

The aim of this challenge is to create AI methods that can exploit temporal information of Sentinel-2 images to artificially enhance its spacial resolution, i.e. the physical size of a pixel in an image. 

### TASK:
Estimate a cultivated land binary map at 2.5m spatial resolution given as input a Sentinel-2 time-series at 10m spatial resolution, therefore resulting in a 4x spatial resolution enhancement.
